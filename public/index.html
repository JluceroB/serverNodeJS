        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Jessica Berrios, I am a current graduate student at the University of New Haven studying Cybersecurity & Networks. I also received my Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity & Networks in May of 2023 from the University of New Haven.</p>
        <p>Currently, aside from attending my classes, I am working on research involving the forensic analysis of ransomware written in Go.</p>
        <p>In addition to my research, I enjoy attending extracurricular activities such as the university hacking club and the Women in Cybersecurity Student Chapter. Outside of my academics, other hobbies include reading and doing CTFs.</p>

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        
          <li><b>Autopsy</b> - Autopsy was used heavily when I was conducting research for my first paper.
            Full forensic images had to be taken of mobile devices and then injested into Autopsy in order to begin analyzing the data
          </li>
          <li><b>Wireshark</b> - Wireshark was first used heavily during many of my courses but most recently it was used in order to identify indicators of compriomse on
            a network packet capture. By completing this excerise I was able to idently packets of interests with the help of Wireshark filters.
          </li>
          <li><b>ADB</b> - ABD was heavily used during my first research papar where a forensic analysis of two-factor authentication applications was analyzed.
            Prior to using Autopsy we had used ADB to manually map out the directories of interest on an android device but also begin collecting artifacts during the beginning phases of analysis.
          </li>
          <li><b>Fiddler</b> - Fidder is a tool that was used during a research project when I was analyzing network traffic being sent from a mobile device. 
            The traffic that was being collected over Wireshark was in HTTPS so we used Fiddler in order to decrypt the traffic.
          </li>
          <li><b>Ghidra</b> - Ghidra was used recently in my Reverse Engineering class where for our final project we were tasked with reverse engineering the WannaCry malware sample.
          </li>
          <li><b>Magnet Acquire</b> - Magnet Acquire was used on multiple occasionas both for class excerises and for research purposes to obtain both full and logical images of 
            Android and Apple mobile devices. 
          </li>
          <li><b>Wazuh</b> - Wazuh is a tool I recently used during the Cyber Collegiate Defence Competition, where I utilized Wazuh
            to set up agents on multiple machines and set up alerts for suspcious activity.  </li>
          <li><b>ELK Stack</b> - Most recently, I utilized the ELK stack during a final project for my Network Defense class in order 
            to parse through a large set of logs and identify important information.
